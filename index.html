		<h2> Gangplank lore </h2>
		<p> As unpredictable as he is brutal, the dethroned reaver king Gangplank is feared far and wide. Once, he ruled the port city of Bilgewater, and while his reign is over, there are those who believe this has only made him more dangerous. Gangplank would see Bilgewater bathed in blood once more before letting someone else take it—and now with pistol, cutlass, and barrels of gunpowder, he is determined to reclaim what he has lost.</p>

When Gangplank destroys it, it explodes and also triggers a chain reaction that explodes other nearby connected kegs with a 0.33 seconds-delay between explosions. The explosions also grant sight of their radiuses for 2 seconds.

			Enemies caught in an explosion are slowed for 2 seconds, and are dealt the triggering attack's damage, dealing bonus physical damage agains champions. Each enemy can only be hit once per chain and the damage dealt ignores 40% of the target's armor.</li>
