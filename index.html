		<h3> Gangplank lore </h3>
		<p> As unpredictable as he is brutal, the dethroned reaver king Gangplank is feared far and wide. Once, he ruled the port city of Bilgewater, and while his reign is over, there are those who believe this has only made him more dangerous. Gangplank would see Bilgewater bathed in blood once more before letting someone else take itâ€”and now with pistol, cutlass, and barrels of gunpowder, he is determined to reclaim what he has lost.</p>
